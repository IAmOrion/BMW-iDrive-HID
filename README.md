# START OCTOBER 2022 EDIT

I've recently had many people reaching out to me for help with their iDrive projects - this seems to be getting popular suddenly.  
I have only tested this with 3 iDrive units.  Part numbers are listed below.  It doesn't work for many newer iDrive units, especially "silver" / ceramic ones.  I do not have the time to reverse engineer / go can bus sniffing etc trying to figure out newer iDrives for a project that, as far as I am concerned, is finished for me.  I've done what I needed and wanted.

So, whilst I can possibly help guide people in the right diretion, I'm not re-writing the entire code to meet someones needs because they've never touched the Arduino IDE before and are new to it.  That's a "you" problem.  Google is your friend.

I tested on a specific set of hardware that was what I needed at the time.  If you're not buying the exact same iDrive I used, and the exact same hardware I used, I just don't have the time to babysit you through what to do, I'm sorry.

If you want to *HIRE* me at an agreed hourly figure to help you re-write the code to suit your needs then that's awesome, get in touch.
I will still offer help & guikdance freely but I just don't have the time to be spending 10+ hours with each person just getting them setup with arduino, going over wiring, then modding code etc.  That's beyond the scope of "free help" as I just don't have the time for it (as I've repeated).

I hope this code can still serve and help others
